## üìÆ M365 Shared Mailbox Sent Items Configuration
These commands are ideal for quickly configuring shared mailbox sent items behavior in Microsoft 365.

Below are solutions to configure this behavior properly.

Open PowerShell locally as administrator and paste the command below. Note that Global Administrator or Exchange Administrator rights are required, and you will need to authenticate during the process.
```bash
Connect-ExchangeOnline -UserPrincipalName <e-mail>
```

Configure sent items to be stored only in the shared mailbox.
```bash
powershellSet-MailboxSentItemsConfiguration -Identity sharedmailbox@yourdomain.com -SendAsItemsCopiedTo From -SendOnBehalfOfItemsCopiedTo From
```

### Outlook Desktop Configuration:
Access account settings to configure sent items storage.
```bash
File > Account Settings > Account Settings > Select Account > Change > More Settings > Advanced
```
