## üõ†Ô∏è Windows Server Scripts
Automate the deployment and configuration of Windows Server environments, including standalone servers, domain controllers, and additional domain controllers. The base configuration script applies essential settings and updates to the server. The domain controller setup script handles domain creation and DNS configuration, while the additional domain controller script manages domain joining and DNS synchronization. Each script includes the baseline server configuration by default, ensuring a consistent setup across all server roles.

### Copy User Groups:
This script copies the exact group memberships of an already existing user and adds a new user to the same groups.
```bash
$ReferenceUser = "j.doe"
$TargetUser  = "a.smith"

# Get groups of the existing user
$Groups = Get-ADUser -Identity $ReferenceUser  -Properties MemberOf | Select-Object -ExpandProperty MemberOf

# Add the new user to the same groups
foreach ($Group in $Groups) {
    Add-ADGroupMember -Identity $Group -Members $TargetUser 
}
```
